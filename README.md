# CitiBikes in Des Moines

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal based on data from CitiBike operation in New York City. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

For this analysis, I used Pandas to clean the .csv file where all the data was stored. Then, I created a set of visualizations in Tableau to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

## Results

## Summary
Overall, Des Moines could be succcessful operating CitiBikes, especially if they did the following:

* Put more bikes in tourist areas.
* Performed maintenance early in the mornings, before 6 AM.
* Charged a base fee (because ride duration is so low).
* Changed the bike shape to be better suited to female bodies (might be a reason why women's numbers are so low)

I think data visualization based on age would be helpful and gathering more information on surveys to portray how comfortable the bikes are, which in turn could be put into a bar graph.
